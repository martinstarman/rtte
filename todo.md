# TODO

- [ ] add possibility to wait in enemy path (should be in idle state)
- [ ] use polygons as `PrimitiveObstacle` (vleue_navigator does not supports polygons right now)
- [ ] stop using gizmos for line of sight and debug (bevy does not suports polygons right now)
- [ ] serialization/deserialization (https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20158)
- [ ] menu
- [ ] add xcf file for all assets
- [ ] consider `enemy_reset_animation_on_state_change` for player
- [ ] weird moving animations
- [ ] minimap? (https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-17/#viewportnode)
- [ ] use 2d mesh for cone of view? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0syaVnpM) (polygon does not implement meshable)
- [ ] use camera pan (https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/16a6a96a80aab50dcc14c8bb73ef09520f77c09d/release-content/release-notes/camera_controllers.md?plain=1#L4)
