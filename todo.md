# TODO

- [ ] add possibility to wait in enemy path (should be in idle state)
- [ ] use polygons as `PrimitiveObstacle` (vleue_navigator does not supports polygons right now)
- [ ] stop using gizmos for line of sight and debug (bevy does not suports polygons right now)
- [ ] serialization/deserialization
- [ ] menu
- [ ] add xcf file for all assets
- [ ] consider `enemy_reset_animation_on_state_change` for player
