# TODOs
[ ] fix player pathfinding on entity selection
[ ] fix sprite selection under another sprite (eg. select enemy under tree)
[ ] use Commands for entity spawning (see `object.rs`)
[ ] add possibility to wait in enemy path (should be in idle state)
[ ] replace `direction.rs` with Bevy CompasOctant
[ ] use polygons as `PrimitiveObstacle` (vleue_navigator does not supports polygons right now)
[ ] stop using gizmos for line of sight and debug (bevy does not suports polygons right now)
[ ] add player UI
